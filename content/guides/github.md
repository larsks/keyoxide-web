## Post a Github proof message

Log in to [github.com](https://github.com) and click on **New gist**.

Name the file **openpgp.md** and copy the following content into it (make sure to replace FINGERPRINT and USERNAME):

```
This is an OpenPGP proof that connects [my OpenPGP key](https://keyoxide.org/FINGERPRINT) to [this Github account](https://github.com/USERNAME). For details check out https://keyoxide.org/guides/openpgp-proofs

```

After creating a public gist, copy the link to the gist.

## Update the PGP key

First, edit the key (make sure to replace FINGERPRINT):

```
gpg --edit-key FINGERPRINT
```

Add a new notation:

```

```

Enter the notation (make sure to update with the link to the post copied above):

```

```

Save the key:

```

Upload the key to WKD or use the following command to upload the key to [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org) (make sure to replace FINGERPRINT):
