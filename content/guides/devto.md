Let's add a decentralized dev.to proof to your OpenPGP keys.

## Post a dev.to proof message

Log in to [dev.to](https://dev.to) and create a new post with the following text (make sure to replace FINGERPRINT and USERNAME):

```
This is an OpenPGP proof that connects [my OpenPGP key](https://keyoxide.org/FINGERPRINT) to [this dev.to account](https://dev.to/USERNAME). For details check out https://keyoxide.org/guides/openpgp-proofs

[Verifying my OpenPGP key: openpgp4fpr:FINGERPRINT]
```

After posting, copy the link to the post.

## Update the PGP key

First, edit the key (make sure to replace FINGERPRINT):

```
gpg --edit-key FINGERPRINT
```

Add a new notation:

```
notation
```

Enter the notation (make sure to update with the link to the post copied above):

```
proof@metacode.biz=https://dev.to/USERNAME/POST_TITLE
```

Save the key:

```
save
```

Upload the key to WKD or use the following command to upload the key to [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org) (make sure to replace FINGERPRINT):

```
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --send-keys FINGERPRINT
```

And you're done! Reload your profile page, it should now show a verified dev.to account.
