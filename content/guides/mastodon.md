## Update the Mastodon account

Log in to your Mastodon instance and click on **Edit profile**.

Add a new item under **Profile metadata** with the label **OpenPGP** and your PGP fingerprint as the content, or with the label **Keyoxide** and your Keyoxide profile URL as the content.

## Update the PGP key

First, edit the key (make sure to replace FINGERPRINT):

```
gpg --edit-key FINGERPRINT
```

Get a list of user IDs and find the index of the one to assign the notation to:

```
list
```

Select the desired user ID (make sure to replace N):

```
uid N
```

Add a new notation:

```
notation
```

Enter the notation (make sure to update the link):

```
proof@metacode.biz=https://INSTANCE.ORG/@USERNAME
```

Save the key:

```
save
```

Upload the key to WKD or use the following command to upload the key to [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org) (make sure to replace FINGERPRINT):

```
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --send-keys FINGERPRINT
```

And you're done! Reload your profile page, it should now show a verified Mastodon account.
